# 🚀 React Learning Journey

Welcome to my **React Learning Playground** — a space where I experiment, build, break, and learn. 😅  
This repository documents everything I’ve done while learning **React.js** — from my first `useState` counter to experimenting with `useEffect`, Tailwind, and beyond.

## 🧩 About This Repo

> “Not everything we code needs to be perfect — this is my learning lab.”

This repo includes small projects, experiments, and random ideas that helped me understand React better.  
Each folder here represents a checkpoint in my learning journey.

## 🧠 Concepts I’ve Explored

- ⚛️ **React Basics** → Components, Props, State
- 🪝 **Hooks** → `useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useRef`
- 💅 **Styling** → Tailwind CSS Integration
- ⚙️ **Vite** → Fast and modern setup for React
- 🧩 **Problem Solving** → Debugging, understanding React Fiber, and reading docs (finally 😆)

## 💡 Why I Made This

Because learning React isn’t just about tutorials —  
it’s about **understanding how things break, and why.**

This repo helps me:  
✅ Track my progress  
✅ Revisit old mistakes  
✅ Celebrate small wins along the way
